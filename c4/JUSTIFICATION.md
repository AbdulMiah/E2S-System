# C4 Justification 
Our C4 diagram covers 3 levels: the context, containers, and components. The fourth level is the code level but we felt that this was not needed. At the current level of detail, our C4 diagram allows us to map out the structure of our project and give an understanding of how our files should be named and organised. We did not feel it was necessary to create diagrams for the fourth level. This is because we already have everything we need to actually write the code ourselves in an IDE. Modern IDEs also have ways of generating class diagrams automatically after the code is written. We could have used level 4 diagrams if we had some extremely complex components that warranted it, but we did not find that to be the case.
